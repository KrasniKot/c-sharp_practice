## Tasks:

### Task 0. Positive is better:
Write a program that assings a random signed number to the variable `number` each time is executed.
Print `number`.
The output should be:
 - The number followed by:
  - if the number is greater than 0: is positive.
  - if the number is 0: is zero.
  - if the number is less than 0: is negative.
 - A new line.

### Task 1. Last Digit:
Write a program that assings a random signed number to the variable `number` each time is executed.
* The output of the program should be:
 * The string Last digit of, followed by
  * the number, followed by
  * the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
   * if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
   * if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
   * if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
  * followed by a new line

### Task 2. Know the alphabet?:
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- Use only one `Console.Write()` function
- Use only one loop in your code

### Task 3. Hexadecimal:
Write a program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal.
- Use only one `Console.Write` function
- Use only one loop in your code
Output example:
```
0: 0x0
1: 0x1
2: 0x2
3: 0x3
...
```

### Task 4. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need:
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
- Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
- The two digits must be different
- `1` and `10` are considered the same combination of the two digits `0` and `1`
- Print only the smallest combination of two digits
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
- The last number should be followed by a new line
- You can only use no more than `3` `Console.WriteLine` functions with string format
- You can only use no more than `2` loops in your code
- You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
