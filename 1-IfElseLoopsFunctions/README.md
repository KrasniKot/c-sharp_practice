## Tasks:

### Task 0. Positive is better:
Make a program that assings a random signed number to the variable `number` each time is executed.
Print `number`.
The output should be:
 - The number followed by:
  - if the number is greater than 0: is positive.
  - if the number is 0: is zero.
  - if the number is less than 0: is negative.
 - A new line.
